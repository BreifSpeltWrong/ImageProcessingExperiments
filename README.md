Heya

## This aint a serious thing. This is basically me wanting to have a CLI based image processing tool. Don't expect something wonderful.

Feel free to commit, but please branch and merge, cause I wanna be able to blame whoever broke it. And don't add IDE config files, it does break other IDEs from time to time.

Javadoc it, and add an author tag at the top.

```java
/**
* @author Al
*/
public class Main {
// code
}
```
